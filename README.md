For launching the launcher, there is a "start.bat" file in the initial folder that starts the interface. 
If the interface does not launch, go to the "portablemc-main" folder and run "start_mine.py".

To run Minecraft, Python and Java are required.
Java - https://www.java.com/download/
Python - https://www.python.org/downloads/

Thank you to everyone who downloaded Swift Launcher.
